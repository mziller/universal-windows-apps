        <p>
            Based on the screen's pixel density (DPI) and resolution, Windows scales images and
            other UI elements to maintain physical sizing across devices. We recommend that you make your
            app <b>scaling aware</b> by providing multiple versions of these assets
            so that they retain quality across different scales. If you don't provide multiple versions,
            Windows will stretch your assets by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            This scenario demonstrates different methods you can use to ensure
            that Windows loads the correct asset depending on scaling. It also shows what
            would have happened if you hadn't provided multiple assets.
            You can choose a scaling method
            based on your app's specific scenarios.
            Use the descriptions below as a guide.
            In some cases, you might want to use multiple methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b>
            Use the simulator to view this scenario at different scales on the PC.
            For the 100% scale, use the 10.6" 1366x768 resolution setting. For 140% use 10.6"
            1920x1080 and for 180% use 10.6" 2560x1440.
            Other scales are possible on phones and other devices.

                    The framework can select an asset from your package based on
                    the current DPI. Include multiple versions of each asset
                    using the following naming convention: image.scale-100.png, image.scale-140.png 
                    and image.scale-180.png. When you use "image.png" within your app, Windows will 
                    select an asset based on the current scale.
                    <br /><br />
                    The HTML framework selects the image
                    when the app is launched and will sometimes change the asset if the scale changes
                    (for example, if the app is moved to a different monitor).
                    In particular, when an image resource is
                    used with a CSS background-image style, it will be reloaded automatically by Windows. An
                    img element, however, is not automatically reloaded. To ensure that your app retains the
                    best display when used in multi-monitor configurations, a small amount of code is needed
                    to make resources in img elements reload. scenario1.js shows how this is done for the
                    image above.

                    Note: Text has been added to the image above in order to make clear which version of the 
                    image is loaded.

                    Instead of including multiple bitmap resources, vector graphics can also be used
                    to make the app scaling aware. Include a single .svg asset and it will retain its
                    quality regardless of scale factor.

                    If you load images that did not come with your app's package or 
                    resource pack (e.g. downloaded from a web server), then you must use the
                    RawPixelsPerViewPixel value to select an appropriate image.
