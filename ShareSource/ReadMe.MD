# Sharing content source app sample

This sample demonstrates how an app shares content with another app. This sample uses classes from the [**Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205967) namespace. Some of the classes you might want to review in more detail are the [**DataTransferManager**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205932) class, which you use to initiate a share operation, and the [**DataPackage**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205873) class, which you use to package the content. Because each share scenario usually involves two apps—the source app and a target app that receives the content—we recommend you install and deploy the [Sharing content target app sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231519) when you install and run this one. This way, you can see how sharing works from end to end.

This sample covers how to share content in a variety of formats, including:

-   Text
-   Web link
-   Application link
-   Images
-   Files
-   Delay-rendered files
-   HTML content
-   Custom data

Also, this sample shows how to share a 30x30 logo and specify its background color, and how to share the app's package family name.

Also, this sample shows how to display text when your app can't support a share operation.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
