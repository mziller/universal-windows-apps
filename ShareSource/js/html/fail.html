                If the user uses a keyboard shortcut to share when your app is not able to support share,
                you can provide a failure message that
                will be displayed in the share pane.  This message should help the user understand why they cannot share and
                what they need to do to complete their task.  You do not need to use this message if your app never supports share.
                Windows provides a default message for that case.
                (This sample has an explicit Share button in order to be illustrate the scenario.
                A typical app would hide or disable the Share button when it had nothing to share.)
            </p>
            <p>Choose the failure display text</p>
            <input class="text-box" id="displayTextInputBox" value="You have selected too many images.  Select less than 50 images and then try again." />
            <p><button id="shareButton">Share</button></p>
