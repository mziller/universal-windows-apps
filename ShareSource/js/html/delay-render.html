                Sometimes you may want provide content in a different format or size for sharing.
                However, you may not want to do the work to prepare content for sharing until the target app actually requests it. In such cases, you should use delayed rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                To demonstrate, please choose an image to be shared. When data is requested by the target app, the image will be resized by the source app. Since image manipulation may take
                some time, the image processing is deferred until it's requested by the target app.
            </p>
            <p>Data Package Title:</p>
            <input class="text-box" id="titleInputBox" value="My image" />
            <p>Data Package Description:</p>
            <input class="text-box" id="descriptionInputBox" value="Selected image from the Share Source sample" />
            <p>Select the image you would like to share</p>
            <p><button class="action" id="chooseImageButton">Select image</button></p>
            <div id="scenarioOutput" class="hidden">
                <img class="imageHolder" id="imageHolder" alt="image holder" />
                <p>
                    The bitmap will not be rendered into the data package until the share target requests it.
