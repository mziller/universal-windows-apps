This sample demonstrates how to use ink functionality (such as capturing ink from user input and performing handwriting recognition on ink strokes) in Windows Store UAP apps using C#.

Specifically, this sample covers using the Windows.UI.Input.Inking APIs to do the following:
-	Capture user input and render as ink strokes
-	Save and load ink strokes 
-	Erase ink strokes 
-	Change which input types (Mouse/Touch/Pen) are used for inking 
-	Recognize handwriting from ink strokes
