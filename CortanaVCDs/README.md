This sample demonstrates integrating with Cortana to provide Voice Command Definitions (VCDs) that allow an application to be invoked in a variety of ways.

Specifically, this sample covers:

-   Installing a VCD file. (AdventureWorksCommands.xml, App.xaml.cs:OnLaunched() )
-   Updating a phrase list within a VCD file at runtime. (TripViewModel.cs:UpdateDestinationPhraseList())
-   Handling App.OnActivation() being called with details of a voice command. (App.xaml.cs:OnActivation())  
-   Handling registration of a background task and hooking it up to a voice command. (Package.appxmanifest, AdventureWorksCommands.xml)
-   Implementing the headless invocation APIs for Cortana to acknowledge the invocation, handle cancellation, and completion of the headless invocation to maintain the contract with Cortana, and avoid being terminated. (AdventureWorksVoiceCommandService.cs:Run())
-   Providing various responses to Cortana, which Cortana will display within its own UI, including text, images, app activation URIs, etc. (AdventureWorksVoiceCommandService.cs:SendCompletionMessageForDestination())
-   Implements disambiguation, providing a user with multiple choices, which can either be chosen via voice, or other input mechanisms. (AdventureWorksVoicecommandService.cs:DisambiguateTrips())
-   Implements a confirmation dialog in Cortana, ensuring a user can review a destructive action that will be taken (AdventureWorksVoiceCommandService.cs:SendCompletionMessageForCancellation())
-   Implements progress screens, ensuring that Cortana does not time out during lengthy I/O operations (AdventureWorksVoiceCommandService.cs:ShowProgressScreen())
-   Infix/Suffix Voice Command support, allowing for more natural phrases to be used. 


The sample also includes a basic application in order to demonstrate how to integrate this functionality with applications. 

Setup
-----

1. Ensure Cortana is signed in, with an MSA account. This can be acheived by opening Cortana once, and following the sign-in process. 
2. Run the application normally once (eg, via f5 debug or deploy/launch). This installs the voice command definitions.
3. Close the app.
4. Click on the microphone icon in Cortana's search bar. 
5. Say one of the supported voice commands.
 

Usage
-----

When Cortana is listening, any of the following voice commands are supported. By default, "London", "Melbourne", and "Yosemite National Park" are provided as sample destinations. New destinations can be added in the app.

- "Adventure Works, show trip to London" [Note: Currently this has a known issue, see below]
- "Adventure Works, when is my trip to London"
- "Adventure Works, cancel trip to London"

Infix and suffix forms are also supported.

- "Show trip to London in Adventure Works"
- "Show my Adventure Works trip to London"

Duplicates can also be handled. Add a second trip to London in the app, and use

- "Adventure Works, cancel trip to London"

for an example of handling duplicate/disambiguation.


Known Issues
------------

* On the windows phone emulator, Cortana is currently unavailable, and will become available in future updates of the SDK. Physical phone hardware should work fine.

* In recent flights of windows, the mechanism that Cortana uses to activate apps has changed to use protocol activation. This results in some commands and links not being able to launch the app. 
	* The SDK release 10069 that is included in VS does not currently support the protocol activation changes needed for the manifest, but an update to the sample will be available soon that demonstrates the changes required when a new release of the SDK has become available.

	* Expect links in Cortana to change to invoking the application via the OnActivated() entrypoint, instead of OnLaunched() in the future. 

* Due to a change in date handling, older versions of AdventureWorks may have some odd dates when restarting. An uninstall of old AdventureWorks sample packages is recommended.

System requirements
-----------------------------

Cortana requires an appropriate recording device, and the device must be associated with a Microsoft Account in order for Cortana to function.
