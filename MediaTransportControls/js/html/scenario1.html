                Select some audio or video files to play.
                While they are playing, you can
                call up the system media transport controls
                in a manner appropriate for your system.
                For example, press the "Play/Pause" key on the keyboard,
                or use the hardware volume controls.

                HTML5 specifies that both audio and video content are supported by both <audio> and <video> elements.
                <audio> elements simply do not render the video stream, so for this sample we will use <video> to
                play video as well as audio-only content.

                HTML5 audio and video elements share more or less the same properties, methods and events, so the same 
                sample script code would work basically unmodified with an <audio> element below in place of <video>.
