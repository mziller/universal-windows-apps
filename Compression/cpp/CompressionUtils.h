// Reads Stream into Destination. It's up to caller to ensure that Destination is not destructed until
// ReadStreamTask::GetTask() is completed. If error is encountered during read Destination doesn't
// change and Stream state is undefined.
// NOTE: Generally you don't need to read entire stream into memory - we only use this task in order to
//       interoperate with Compression API style buffer compression/decompression. Recommended way to
//       work with WinRT streams of unknown length (including Comressor/Decompressor) is processing
//       data chunk by chunk as it arrives.
