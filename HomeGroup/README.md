# HomeGroup app sample

This sample demonstrates how to use a HomeGroup to open, search, and share files. This sample uses some of the HomeGroup options found in the [**Windows.Storage.Pickers**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207928) and [**Windows.Storage.KnownFolders**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227151). In particular, it uses [**Windows.Storage.Pickers.PickerLocationId**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207890) enumeration and the [**Windows.Storage.KnownFolders.homeGroup**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227153) property to select files contained in a HomeGroup.

This sample covers the following processes:

-   How to open an item picker at a HomeGroup
-   How to search a HomeGroup
-   How to stream a video from a HomeGroup
-   How to conduct advanced searches in a HomeGroup
