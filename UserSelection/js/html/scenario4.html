        <p>In this scenario the parent div's -ms-user-select attribute is set "element", thus enabling selection for the parent div. 
           You will find 5 child divs that have their -ms-user-select attribute set to "inherit", "element", "text", "initial" and "none" respectively.</p>
        <p> The user has the ability to select everything within the div with attribute set to "element". However if you begin selection from the div marked "text" can select anything on the page. 
           The "inherit" div just like the parent div is selectable. However the "auto" div takes on the "text" behavior from the parent that is marked "element".
