# Animation metrics sample

This sample shows how to use the Animation Metrics APIs ([**Windows.UI.Core.AnimationMetrics**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241916) to access the raw parameters that define the animations in the Windows [Animation Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465165). This info can help developers of applications and application frameworks to create animations that are consistent with Windows and other apps that use the Windows Animation Library.

The sample shows the metrics involved in the following scenarios:

- Adding an item to a list
- Bringing a new page on the screen

**Note** The Universal Windows app samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10, go to [Windows 10](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)

## Build the sample

1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
2. Go to the directory to which you unzipped the sample. Then go to the subdirectory containing the sample in the language you desire - either C++, C#, or JavaScript. Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file. 
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**. 

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select Debug > Start Without Debugging. 

## How to use the sample

The sample provides three situations for which you retrieve the raw parameters that define the animations: the item being added in an AddToList animation, the item being affected in an AddToList animation, and a page of content being brought onto the screen with EnterPage. None of these animations themselves are shown; instead, the parameters are retrieved and displayed.
