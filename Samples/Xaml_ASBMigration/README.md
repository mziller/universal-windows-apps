# AutoSuggestBox migration sample

This sample shows how to migrate your Windows 8.1 app to Windows 10 by replacing your SearchBox with an AutoSuggestBox.  With the improvements in AutoSuggestBox, you will get the same end-user experience across all supported Windows 10 devices.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Add a glyph to your AutoSuggestBox:** With the new QueryIcon API, you can specify a glyph to put in the TextBox of your AutoSuggestBox without re-templating.
- **Add keyboarding support:** The QuerySubmitted event has been added to support all cases where an item could be selected, including Enter key, mouse click, or tap.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
