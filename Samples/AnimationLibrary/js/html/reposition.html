            Use the Reposition animation to move an element to a new location. This animation is
            best used when an element needs to move due to a user interaction or a change in layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on the distance the affected element needs to be moved, it may appear
            to animate differently. Typically, smaller distances have a slower velocity than
            larger distances. This is because all reposition animations have the same duration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reposition animates only the elements that change position in a layout. Depending
            on the layout, there may be times when a non-animated element is adjacent to an
            animated element. The non-animated element may jump to its final state faster than
            the animated element can reach its own. In this example, the resized element sometimes
            overlaps with the repositioned element. Because of this, you should be mindful of
            how other animations in your layout can affect your application's experience.
