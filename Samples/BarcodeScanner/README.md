# Barcode Scanner Sample

This sample shows how to create a barcode scanner, claim it for exclusive use, enable it to receive data, and read a barcode. This sample uses [**Windows.Devices.PointOfService**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298071) API.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

1.  **Create the barcode scanner**

    Uses the [**BarcodeScanner.GetDefaultAsync**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn263790) to get the first available barcode scanner.

2.  **Claim the barcode scanner for exclusive use**

    Uses the [**ClaimScannerAsync**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn297696) to claim the device.

3.  **Add event handlers**

    Uses [**DataReceived**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278556) and [**ReleaseDeviceRequested**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278578) events.

    When an application gets a request to release its exclusive claim to the barcode scanner, it must handle the request by retaining the device; otherwise, it will lose its claim. The second scenario in this sample shows the release and retain functionality. The event handler for [**ReleaseDeviceRequested**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278578) shows how retain the device.

The app package manifest shows how to specify the device capability name for the Point of Service (POS) devices. All POS apps are required declare [**DeviceCapability**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211430) in the app package manifest, either by using "PointofService" as shown in this sample or by using a device specific GUID, such as "C243FFBD-3AFC-45E9-B3D3-2BA18BC7EBC5" for a barcode scanner.

The following list shows the barcode scanners that were used with this sample:

-   Honeywell 1900GSR-2
-   Honeywell 1200g-2
-   Intermec SG20

In addition to the devices listed, you can use barcode scanners from various manufacturers that adhere to the [USB HID POS Scanner specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=309230).
