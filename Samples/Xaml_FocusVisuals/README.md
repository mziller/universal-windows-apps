# Focus visuals sample

This sample shows how to take advantage of the new system drawn focus visuals, or to create your own custom focus visuals if the system drawn ones do not fit your needs.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Use the system focus visuals in custom controls:** By using UseSystemFocusVisuals and  the attached property Control.IsTemplateFocusTarget, you can specify which piece of your control template should draw the focus visuals.
- **Create your own focus visuals:** Add back the focus visual states from Windows 8.1 (included in the sample), and set UseSystemFocusVisuals to false to specify your own visuals.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
