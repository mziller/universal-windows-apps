# Accelerometer sensor sample

This sample shows how to use the [**Accelerometer**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225687) API.

This sample allows the user to view the acceleration forces along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes for a 3-axis accelerometer. You can choose one of four scenarios:

-   Accelerometer data events
-   Accelerometer shake events
-   Poll accelerometer readings
-   Accelerometer orientation changed
-   Accelerometer data events batching

### Acclerometer Data Events

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Data Events** option, the app begins streaming accelerometer readings in real time.

### Accelerometer Shake Events

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Shake Events** option, the app displays the cumulative number of shake events each time an event occurs. (The app first increments the event count and then renders the most recent value.)

### Poll Accelerometer Readings

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Polling** option, the app will retrieve the sensor readings at a fixed interval.

### Accelerometer Orientation Changed

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **OrientationChange** option, the app will display both raw sensor readings, as well as sensor readings that align with the current display orientation.

### Accelerometer data events batching**

When you choose the **Enable** button for the **Data Events** option, the app begins streaming accelerometer readings in batches.
