# Speech and text-to-speech sample

This sample demonstrates the usage of Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis (Text to speech) within Universal Applications

Specifically, this sample covers:

-   Unconstrained grammars for dictation and web searches
-   Constrained grammars using List constraints and GRXML constraint files
-   Recognition with and without UI
-   Continuous recognition, for dictation or commanding.
-   Text to speech/speech Synthesis
-   Synthesis using SSML files
-   Synthesis voice configuration
-   Translations for Speech Recognition and Text To Speech for supported languages. Translations provided may not be using ideal phrasing, and are provided for demonstration purposes only.

## Security and Privacy

Some speech recognition features require acceptance of the Microsoft Privacy Policy. Information about this privacy policy can be found in the Settings app, under Privacy -> Speech, Inking and Typing. You must view the privacy policy in order to accept it. To view the privacy policy, press the Privacy Policy link on the Speech, Inking and Typing settings page. 

You can disable functionality that requires accepting this policy by turning off "Getting to know you" under Settings -> Privacy -> Speech, Inking and Typing. The samples will indicate to you if the privacy policy has not been accepted where necessary.

In the samples, the scenarios that require acceptance of the privacy policy are the unconstrained Dictation and Web Search scenarios, and the Continuous Dictation scenarios. The other scenarios use local recognition only, and can function without being required to accept the privacy policy.

## Known Issues

On small screen devices, part of the UI may be rendered off the right side of the screen. This is due to a layout issue with the sample app, and will be fixed in upcoming releases, and should not significantly impact functionality. It is not recommended to use the sample in landscape mode.

Currently, RecognizeWithUIAsync will fail if the system language does not match the speech language in use in the sample. This will be addressed in a future windows update.

The Privacy link into settings was changed and only functions correctly on Windows Build 10130 or newer.
