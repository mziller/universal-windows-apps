# Message dialog sample

This sample demonstrates how to use a [**MessageDialog**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208674) for displaying dialogs, setting commands and the actions they will perform, and changing the default button.

The [**Windows.UI.Popups**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242180) namespace contains the [**MessageDialog**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208674) class. You can use this class to present an urgent message that the user must acknowledge before continuing, or to present an urgent question that the user must answer.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10, go to [Windows 10](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)
