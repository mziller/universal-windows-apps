Lamp Sample
-----------

This sample demonstrates Windows.Devices.Lights.Lamp API usage. The Windows.Devices.Lights.Lamp API enables applications to use the camera flash
independently of the capture device. The Windows.Devices.Lights.Lamp API allows for more control over the flash device and consumes less power and CPU
resources because the overhead of running capture device is avoided.

This sample covers the three most common scenarios for utilizing the flash:

Scenario 1: Acquiring a Lamp instance. There are two methods for acquiring the lamp device:
     1)  When you choose the "Get Lamp Instance from Device Information" button, the app demonstrates acquiring Lamp by calling DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync()
     and passing in the device selection string for the lamp device. Using this method you have more control over picking a specific lamp device. In this example
     we get the back lamp device, which is most common lamp location.
     2) When you choose the "Get Default Lamp Instance" button, the app demonstrates a simplified method for getting the default lamp device with Lamp.GetDefaultAsync() call. 

Scenario 2: Enable Lamp and Settings adjustment. This scenario demonstrates determining the capabilities of the lamp and adjusting those capabilities.
    1) When you choose the "Adjust Brightness and turn on Lamp" button, the app queries the lamp device for current brightness level. Then the app demonstrates adjusting the lamp
    brightness level to 0.5, or 50%. 
    2) When you choose "Adjust Color" button, the app queries the lamp device for Color capability. If the capability is supported the app then adjusts the lamp color to Blue.

Scenario 3: Lamp Device Change Events. This sample demonstrates registering for Lamp.AvailablityChanged event. If another application on the device starts using the camera, control of the lamp is taken away from your app.
When this happens, an AvailablityChanged event is raised. In this scenario we demonstrate registering for the Lamp.AvailablityChanged event and handling that event by updating the UI when the event is raised. We acquire
the default lamp device when page loads and provide a toggle to turn the lamp on and off. To raise the AvailablityChanged event for your app, launch another app that uses the camera,. Launching the built-in camera app is recommend.
    1) When you choose "Register for AvailablityChanged Event" button, the app registers for the AvailablityChanged event
    2) When you choose "Unregister for AvailablityChanged Event", the app unregisters for the AvailablityChanged event.
