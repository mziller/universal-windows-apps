# Proximity Sensor Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the Windows.Devices.Sensors.ProximitySensor API.

This sample allows the user to view the proximity detection reading as a boolean value. You can choose one of two scenarios:

-   Proximity sensor data events
-   Polling proximity sensor readings

### Proximity Sensor Data Events

When you choose the Enable button for the **Data Events** option, the app will begin displaying proximity sensor detection readings in real time.

### Polling Proximity Sensor Readings

When you choose the Get Data button for the **Polling** option, the app will retrieve the current sensor readings.

**Proximity Monitoring to Turn the Display On or Off**

When you choose the Enable button for the **Display On/Off** option, the app will request the system to monitor the proximity sensor detection state to automatically turn the display on or off.
