# x:DeferLoadStrategy sample

This sample shows how to reduce your app's startup time by deferring the creation of elements defined in your markup until you really need them.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Create incidental UI when needed:** By responding to an event and calling FindName, you can realize your elements based on user interaction.
- **Create adaptive UIs that are less expensive:** By deferring elements and then targeting them with the VisualStateManager, you can reduce the footprint of your adaptive UIs in form factors that don't match the specified conditions of the VisualState.
- **Defer control template parts:** If you are creating custom controls that has pieces that you expect to not be used as often, you can defer those pieces of the control and only create them if the conditions under which those template parts are used is met.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
