# Windows Runtime in-process component authoring with proxy\stub generation sample for C++

Create proxies and stubs for a Windows Runtime in-process component that is consumed in C++, JS, and C#.

**Note**  This sample was created using one of the universal app templates available in Visual Studio. It shows how its solution is structured so it can run on both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. For more info about how to build apps that target Windows and Windows Phone with Visual Studio, see [Build apps that target Windows and Windows Phone 8.1 by using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn609832).

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
