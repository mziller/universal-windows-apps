# XAML UI Basics sample

This sample shows all of the XAML controls in an interactive format.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Specify XAML controls in markup:** Each control page shows the markup used to create each example
- **Basic layout:** This sample will show all of the possible layout options for your app and allow you to interact with the panels to show how to achieve any layout you are looking for.
- **Adaptive UI:** In addition to showing how each control responds to different form factors, the app itself is responsive and shows various methods for achieving adaptive UI.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
