# Media Transport Controls sample

This sample shows how to create customized media transport controls for the Media Element in your XAML Windows App.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Set up the custom template:** We can add a new template in our Themes/generic.xaml folder and create a custom template. We also added a class called CustomControls.cs 
which show how to use the custom template in your app
- **Add a custom button:** In generic.xaml we added a custom button in our CommandBar and show how to reference it and make it usable in CustomControls.cs
- **Change the color of the slider:** We added references in app.xaml for a custom brush which we then used to change the color of our media slider

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
