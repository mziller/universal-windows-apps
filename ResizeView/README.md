# Resize view sample

This sample shows how to customize the size of your app's view.

The sample shows the following techniques:

- Resizing the view.
- Setting a minimum size for the view.
- Launching at a specific size.

**Note** Although the sample will compile and run, the level of functionality will depend on which build of Windows you are running and what device you are running it on.
In particular, the view resizing feature is not enabled on phones or on PCs in Tablet mode because those systems do not permit free resizing.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
