# Cash Drawer Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the [**Windows.Devices.PointOfService.CashDrawer**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298071) API.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

1.  **Opening a cash drawer**

    This scenario demonstrates how to find, claim, and enable a Cash Drawer, and then open the drawer.

2.  **Waiting for the drawer to close**

    This scenario demonstrates how to set up an event handler for the drawer closing.

3.  **Multiple instances of cash drawer**

    This scenario demonstrates the claim/release model used by the Cash Drawer API by allowing the user to manager two cash drawer instances with UI controls for claiming, retaining, and releasing the drawer objects.
